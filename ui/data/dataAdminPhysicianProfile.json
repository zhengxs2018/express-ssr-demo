      "content": "I am the founder of the Sleep Medicine Centers of Western New York which was first established in 2002. Although I'm Board Certified in Neurology and Sleep Medicine, I focus the majority of my practice on the treatment of adult and pediatric sleep disorders such as sleep apnea, insomnia, narcolepsy, and restless legs among many others.\n\nIn addition, I am a Clinical Associate Professor of Neurology at UB where I teach students, residents, and fellows the joys of sleep medicine and engage in clinical research. I love what we do for patients and how much we can improve their lives. And as much as I enjoy helping our patients, I also enjoy working with our amazing staff and other providers. They are an incredibly smart bunch and they always manage to put a smile on my face!"
